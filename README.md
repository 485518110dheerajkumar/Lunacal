# LUNACAL INTERNSHIP CHELANGING TASK
The task involves creating a dynamic web page divided into two sections. On the right-hand side, there are two interactive cards. The first card contains three clickable buttons, each designed to reveal specific content when clicked. These buttons can be used to display different text or information, making it easy for users to access the content they need without navigating away from the page.

The second card also has three buttons, each serving a unique function related to image management within the webpage. The first button, labeled "Add Image," allows users to upload and display images directly on the page, enhancing the visual aspect of the content. The second button, "Preview," provides functionality to hide one of the displayed images, allowing users to control what is visible at any given time. Finally, the third button is designed to bring back the previously hidden image, offering a seamless way to toggle between hidden and visible states.

This setup provides a user-friendly interface that not only organizes content efficiently but also allows for interactive engagement with multimedia elements, making it a versatile and visually appealing web page.
